# Beehive

Beehive is a library to manage access to application services. Services are essentially targets of actions that can fail. Beehive provides a group of tools that can be composed together depending on your Service's needs: metrics, circuit breakers, in process load balancers, patterns, and more.

Actions can be submitted in either a synchronous or asynchronous manner. Beehive was designed with both performance and concurrency in mind.

## Version

This library has not yet hit alpha. It is used in production at Staples SparX. However, the API may still change.

In particular: the project will likely be moved from Lein to Gradle. It will be split so that the Java component can be used without Clojure.

## Usage

The basis of Beehive is the ServiceExecutor interface. A default implementation can be created from the static methods on the Service class.

```java
String name = "Identity Service";
int poolSize = 10;
int concurrencyLevel = 1000;
ServiceExecutor service = Service.defaultService(name, poolSize, concurrencyLevel);
```

In order can either submit or perform an action on this service. A submitted action is ran on the threadpool associated with the service. A performed action is completed on the thread calling performAction.

```java
ResilientAction<Integer> action = new ResilientAction<> {
    @Override
    public String run() throws Exception {
        URL obj = new URL("identity-service-url");
        HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
        return con.getResponseCode();
    }
}

ResilientPromise<Integer> promise = service.performAction(action);
Integer result = promise.awaitResult();
// Or:
long timeoutInMillis = 100;
ResilientFuture<Integer> future = service.submitAction(action, timeoutInMillis);
Integer result = future.get();
```

The default service includes both metrics and a load balancer. Actions that return successfully will be tallied as successes. Thrown exceptions will be tallied as errors. And a timeout will be tallied as a timeout.

There are two main mechanisms of back pressure to protect the service.

First, the concurrencyLevel is the maximum amount of uncompleted actions that a service can be working on at one time. Both performed and submitted actions add to this restriction.

Second, if a certain threshold is passed for failures (timeouts + errors) the circuit will open for a configurable time. Actions will be rejected while the circuit is open.
